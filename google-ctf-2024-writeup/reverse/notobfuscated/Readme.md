## Description

```
True story: I had planned on learning to write LLVM passes
and use them for obfuscation for this year's gCTF challenge.
However, when I compiled this code with optimizations enabled,
I decided I didn't need to write an obfuscator.

It's a crackme, you know the drill. GL HF! 

Note: The challenge outputs the flag in the wrong format, instead of "ctf{", use "CTF{" when submitting the flag.
